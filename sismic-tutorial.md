# Sismic tutorial through example

The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how to implement and test a statechart with the [Sismic library](https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/sismic), through a complete example. It will also follow the methodology described in the scientific article [A method for testing and validating executable statechart models](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-018-0676-3), that is supported by Sismic.
